+Waggle_Dance_Simulation 🐝 (aka : Soubol سبل = Paths in Arabic )
this  is an unfinished first real  project that I began coding the summer of the year 2023 after taking a course in C++ programming language 
in the university.
The motivation behind the project : 
I've always thought about the intelligence as a mysterious idea. looked into nature, reading about the mention
of bees in the Quran (holy book for Muslims) and their miraculous behaviour 
وَأَوْحَىٰ رَبُّكَ إِلَى النَّحْلِ أَنِ اتَّخِذِي مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا وَمِنَ الشَّجَرِ وَمِمَّا يَعْرِشُونَ (68). 
And your Lord inspired the bees: “Make ˹your˺ homes in the mountains, the trees, and in what people construct,
 ثُمَّ كُلِي مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ فَاسْلُكِي سُبُلَ رَبِّكِ ذُلُلًا ۚ يَخْرُجُ مِن بُطُونِهَا شَرَابٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَانُهُ فِيهِ شِفَاءٌ لِّلنَّاسِ ۗ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ (69)
 and feed from ˹the flower of˺ any fruit ˹you please˺ and follow the ways your Lord has made easy for you.” From their bellies comes forth liquid of varying colours,
in which there is healing for people. Surely in this is a sign for those who reflect.







َ
so when searching I was fascinated by the way that a working bee that found a food source will communicate the exact
position of the food source. the working bee will perform a waggling movement that every bee will understand. 
based on the angle of the food source and its distance. this was discovered by the Austrian entomologist Karl von Frish *1*. 
The idea : 
the idea was to create a graphical interface to interact with . where you find the worker bee in the hive. you give in the distance where the bee
found the food resource. the angle of the food resource depending on the sun's position. and then the bee performs the waggle dance based on these 
two specific variables. in reality, it's way too complex.

Thoughts on the project  :     
it was a quite new experience of learning by doing and discovering how you transform the idea 
of the bee behaviour into code.
   - things I've learned: - using the SDL library 
                          -  importing different libraries and working with them
                           - creating a graphical interface from scratch 
                           - Rendering an Image, controlling image frames, controlling the flow
                              of the time of apparel of a window and closing it.
     -some difficulties :
     the first time I worked on the project it was a little bit complicated as a first project and I thought.  it
     requires more time and effort. On the bright side, I wanted this project as a way of reducing friction and
     just beginning coding a project. and that is what the goal was.
     so anyone is welcome to modify the code and fix or add an idea to it.
