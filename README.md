Waggle Dance Simulation üêù (aka Soubol ÿ≥ÿ®ŸÑ = Paths in Arabic)
Introduction
This project, my first major coding endeavor, began during the summer of 2023 after I completed a course in C++ programming at the university. The idea behind the simulation is inspired by the fascinating behavior of bees and their incredible method of communication‚Äîthe waggle dance. The purpose of the project was to simulate this behavior using a graphical interface, allowing interaction with the worker bee and the representation of its dance based on real-world variables like the food source's distance and angle.

Motivation
I've always been intrigued by the concept of intelligence, especially how it manifests in nature. While researching, I came across the remarkable communication system used by bees. A worker bee, upon finding a food source, performs a waggle dance to communicate the exact location of the food to other bees. This movement is based on two critical factors:

Distance to the food source.
Angle of the food source relative to the sun's position.
This fascinating behavior was discovered by Austrian entomologist Karl von Frisch. For more details, you can read his Nobel Prize lecture here.

Project Concept
The goal of this project is to create a graphical interface where users can simulate the waggle dance. Here‚Äôs how it works:

Worker Bee: You control a bee within a hive.
Inputs: You provide the distance to the food source and the angle, based on the sun's position.
Waggle Dance: The bee performs the waggle dance according to these two variables, demonstrating how it communicates the food's location to the other bees.
In reality, the process is far more complex than what this simulation can model, but it serves as an initial introduction to the behavior.

What I've Learned
While developing this project, I gained hands-on experience with several key concepts:

Using the SDL Library: Implementing graphical rendering with the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).
Importing and Working with Libraries: Integrating various libraries and understanding how they interact.
Graphical Interface Creation: Designing a user interface from scratch, including rendering images and managing graphical windows.
Time Flow Management: Controlling how images and windows are displayed and how time affects the flow of the program.
Challenges Encountered
As a first real project, it presented many challenges. The complexity of working with graphical interfaces and rendering was overwhelming at times. However, these challenges provided valuable learning experiences and helped me build confidence in my coding abilities. The project required more time and effort than initially expected, but the ultimate goal was to reduce the friction in starting a coding project and simply dive in.

Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
Graphics Library: SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
Future Work
While this version of the simulation is far from complete, it has served as a foundation for me to explore more complex aspects of the waggle dance and expand the model in the future. There is still much to be learned, especially in terms of creating more realistic and accurate simulations.
